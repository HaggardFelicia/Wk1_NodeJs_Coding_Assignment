# ToDo NodeJS Coding Assignment

## Finish the project I started in the previous video

- [x] Add POST, GET by ID, PUT By Id, DELETE By ID functionality.
- [x] So your (by Id) methods should look like this when executed from Postman:
  - [x] GET by ID - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}/45
  - [x] PATCH or PUT  by ID - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}/89
  - [x] DELETE by ID - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}/9
  - [x] GET - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}
  - [x] POST - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}
    - [x] These URLs are for viewing the results in Postman and the ID should show in your output
- [x] You should have 5 methods in all (GET, GET by ID, POST, PUT or PATCH by ID, DELETE by ID)
- [x] Your localhost:3000 should show your actuator message: "Service is up"
- [x] ***DON'T FORGET TO STORE - Implement in-memory data storage define an array or other data type.***
