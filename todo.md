# ToDo NodeJS Coding Assignment

## Finish the project I started in the previous video

- Add POST, GET by ID, PUT By Id, DELETE By ID functionality.
- So your (by Id) methods should look like this when executed from Postman:
  - GET by ID - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}/45
  - PATCH or PUT by ID - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}/89
  - DELETE by ID - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}/9
  - GET - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}
  - POST - http://localhost:3000/{your context name}
- These URLs are for viewing the results in Postman and the ID should show in your output
- You should have 5 methods in all (GET, GET by ID, POST, PUT or PATCH by ID, DELETE by ID)
- Your localhost:3000 should show your actuator message: "Service is up"
- ***DON'T FORGET TO STORE - Implement in-memory data storage define an array or other data type.***
